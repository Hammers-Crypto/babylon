[Babylon](https://babylonchain.io) provides a suite of security-sharing
protocols between Bitcoin and the PoS world. It provides two inter-connected
protocols:

- **Bitcoin timestamping:** Submits succinct and verifiable timestamps of any
  data (such as PoS blockchains) to Bitcoin.
- **Bitcoin staking:** Enables Bitcoin holders to provide economic security to
  any decentralized system through trustless (and self-custodian) staking.
